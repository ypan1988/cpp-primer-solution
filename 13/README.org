What is a copy constructor? When is it used?
#+END_QUOTE

A constructor is the *copy constructor* if its first parameter is a *reference*
to the class type and any additional parameters have *default values*.

Copy initialization ordinarily uses the copy constructor (or the move
constructor), and it happens when we
+ Define variables using an =
+ Pass an object as an argument to a parameter of nonreference type
+ Return an object from a function that has a nonreference return type
+ Brace initialize the elements in an array or the members of an aggregate class
+ Some class types also use copy initialization for the objects they allocate.
