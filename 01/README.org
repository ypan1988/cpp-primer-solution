   Review the documentation for your compiler and determine what file
   naming convention it uses. Compile and run the main program from
   page 2.

** Exercise 1.2
   
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often
   treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and
   rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure
   indicator from main.

   #+BEGIN_SRC C
int main()
{
  return -1;
}

** Exercise 1.3
   
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Write a program to print ~Hello, World~ on the standard output.
   #+END_QUOTE
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello, World" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
   #+END_SRC
** Exercise 1.4
   
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Our program used the addition operator, +, to add two
   numbers. Write a program that uses the multiplication operator, *,
   to print the product instead.
   #+END_QUOTE

   #+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Enter two numbers:" << std::endl;
  int v1 = 0, v2 = 0;
  std::cin >> v1 >> v2;
  std::cout << "The product of " << v1 << " and " << v2
            << " is " << v1 * v2 << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
   #+END_SRC
   
** Exercise 1.5
   
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   We wrote the output in one large statement. Rewrite the program to use
   a separate statement to print each operand.
   #+END_QUOTE
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC C
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
  std::cout << "Enter two numbers:" << std::endl;
  int v1 = 0, v2 = 0;
  std::cin >> v1 >> v2;
  std::cout << "The product of ";
  std::cout << v1;
  std::cout << " and ";
  std::cout << v2;
  std::cout << " is ";
  std::cout << v1 * v2;
  std::cout << std::endl;
  return 0;
