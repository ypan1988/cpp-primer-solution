** Exercise 1.2
   
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Change the program to return -1. A return value of -1 is often
   treated as an indicator that the program failed. Recompile and
   rerun your program to see how your system treats a failure
   indicator from main.

   #+BEGIN_SRC C
int main()
{
  return -1;
}
