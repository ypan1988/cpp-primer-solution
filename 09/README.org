   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   Which is the most appropriate—a ~vector~, a ~deque~, or a ~list~ — for the
   following program tasks? Explain the rationale for your choice. If there is
   no reason to prefer one or another container, explain why not.
   + (a) Read a fixed number of words, inserting them in the container
     alphabetically as they are entered. We’ll see in the next chapter that
     associative containers are better suited to this problem.
   + (b) Read an unknown number of words. Always insert new words at the back.
     Remove the next value from the front.
