   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   What is a null statement? When might you use a null statement?
   #+END_QUOTE
   
   A null statement is a single semicolon:
   #+BEGIN_SRC C++
; // null statement   
   #+END_SRC

   A null statement is useful where the language requires a statement but the
   program’s logic does not. Such usage is most common when a loop’s work can be
   done within its condition.
