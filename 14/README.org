** Exercise 14.1
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   In what ways does an overloaded operator differ from a built-in operator? In
   what ways are overloaded operators the same as the built-in operators?
   #+END_QUOTE

   Difference:
   - An overloaded operator can be called directly as normal function, while a
     built-in operator cannot.
   - Overloaded opereators do not preserve order of evaluation and/or
     short-circuit evaluation.

   Similarity:
   - An overloaded operator has the same precedence and associativity as the
     corresponding built-in operator.

   compound-assignment operators for ~Sales_data~.

istream& operator>>(istream &is, Sales_data &item);
ostream& operator<<(ostream &os, const Sales_data &item);
Sales_data operator+(const Sales_item &lhs, const Sales_item &rhs);
Sales_data& Sales_data::operator+=(const Sales_item &rhs);
