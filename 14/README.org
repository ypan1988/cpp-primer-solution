   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   In what ways does an overloaded operator differ from a built-in operator? In
   what ways are overloaded operators the same as the built-in operators?
   #+END_QUOTE

   Difference:
   - An overloaded operator can be called directly as normal function, while a
     built-in operator cannot.
   - Overloaded opereators do not preserve order of evaluation and/or
     short-circuit evaluation.

   Similarity:
   - An overloaded operator has the same precedence and associativity as the
     corresponding built-in operator.
